# Temple Project

## Background
Millions of people visit places of worship daily all across the world. Many wait for hours in overcrowded queues and walk several kilometres through harsh terrain to get a glimpse (at times lasting a fraction of a second) of their deity. Many times various places of worship have their intricate details & restrictions that pose further conditions on the already limited time for the devotees to spend with their deities.

### The Problem of VIP culture
Such a huge demand and such short supply lead to unique challenges and workarounds by the people who can afford those workarounds. It's not uncommon for busy places of worship to offer unsanctioned favours & special VIP access to friends, extended families, bureaucrats, etc. It may manifest as a hush-hush small-scale corruption to overt black markets.

### Adapting to the future: Metaverse
Technologies such as Metaverse & Ethereum may be leveraged to build a more transparent system to address such problems. This hobby project aims to explore one such solution.

## Proposed solution
I start with a simple ticket booking system which may be thought of as closely related to NFTs. Although, the ownership of a ticket is time-dependent and only relevant till a point in time. A user-facing DAPP may also be built to present an easy-to-use interface to users. Features such as time-sensitive bidding, reselling tickets, the ability for 3rd parties to add/manage places of worship, etc. may also be implemented with time.

## Skill Demonstration
This portfolio project is designed to demonstrate the following skill sets:
- [] Upgradable Smart Contract
 - [] Data Smart Contract will store a mapping from a reservation to an owner.
 - [] Application Contract will then be iteratively written to use the Data Contract to support more sophisticated use cases.
- [] TDD approach for developing Smart Contracts.
- [] Privacy & Data Protection
- [] Security
 - CEI Pattern
- [] Oracle
 - Does it make sense to start using the actual current time instead of block time? Would that time be fetched using 3rd party oracles?
